These are my solutions to the 'Advent of code 2022' event.
I didn't use Ai for any of this, since it's all about finding clever situations to the different problems,
I did however have to research for stuff like specific functions, usually from the documentation or from stack exchange - I used this event to mainly develop my python skills.
